# POLISCI753_tutorials

These are all of the tutorials and solutions sets used in Network Analysis at Umass Amherst, PS753 and DACSS697E.

# Summer 2022 notes

@stevelinberg is revising some of the content in the tutorials, and doing some code and project cleanup, as an independent study project.

A couple of housekeeping notes:

- an .Rproj file was created and added to the repository, [as recommended by RStudio staff](https://community.rstudio.com/t/should-rproj-files-be-added-to-gitignore/1269/4)
- .html files (generated by running the learnr tutorials) were removed from the repo; they shouldn't be necessary, and pollute the commit space as they are updated every time local copies of the tutorials are run with any changes, whether committed or not
